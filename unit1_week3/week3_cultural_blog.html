        <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>
          <p>Pairing with others is an important part of coding. The best way to get better at this skill is to receive feedback from those you have paired with.</p>
        <h3>Pairing</h3>
          <p>Pairing with someone else is kind of scary. When you work on your own you can make all the stupid mistakes by yourself without anyone to watch you. You also can think through each thing at your own pace. With someone else, though, everything is out in front of someone else. You have to learn to not be embarassed to not know something. It can also be difficult if the other person wants to go through something either faster or slower than you feel comfortable.</p>
          <p>At the same time, though, it can be fun to work with someone else. Ideas that you never would have had on your own pop up and you get to explore someone else's mind a little bit.</p>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
          <p>Getting feedback can be kind of hard. Everyone wishes he was perfect, but no one is. I think it can be very interesting to see how other people see the world. At its core, feedback is a statement of how that other person saw spending time with you. That is very valuable.</p>
          <p>Based on the feedback I received, I am going to really concentrate on keeping communication open and constant. You can't pair if you don't communicate so I will continue to work on this.</p>
          <p>Even harder than receiving feedback is giving feedback. I went to college for music and we would spend a lot of time giving each other feedback on our playing. One of the types of feedback I always disliked receiving was what I described as "touchy feely" comments. Based on what I have learned at Dev Bootcamp I would now describe this feedback as not specific. All I would learn from these comments was that I could be playing better, but I did not understand in what way I should be better. That was not helpful. Also, feeback should be actionable, which essentially means that the person can do something about the feedback. Finally, the feedback should be kind. This doesn't mean that all feedback should be positive, but that it should be limited to things that are strictly true. You wouldn't say "You are terrible at this", you would say what specifically you think the person did poorly. I'm not sure if "kind" is the right word for this, but acronyms are important.</p>
          <p>Feedback is key for learning to pair so I'm glad that DBC incorporates it in the course. I hope by the end I'm much better at it than I am now!</p>
