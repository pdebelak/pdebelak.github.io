I've been learning [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) lately and am starting to
feel more comfortable with the language. Just writing code on my own, though,
it's hard to really advance as quickly or as well as I would by writing code
with others.

To solve this problem and improve my skills I decided to contribute to an open
source project. Since I have been working on an application that uses markdown I
decided to [earmark](https://github.com/pragdave/earmark) which is a pure elixir
markdown processor (unlike many that connect to c functions to actually parse
the markdown).
