title: I Don't Want to Install GUI Software!
description: Peter is tired of people telling him about GUI software to install. See why.

The other day someone at work was telling us all to get the [dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) plugin for [alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). I wasn't familiar with dash, so I looked it up. Once I established that it was GUI software I lost all interest.

We live in a world with the internet. From what I can tell dash is like a broken version of google chrome. Almost every GUI program is a broken version of google chrome! Dash doesn't let you ask questions on stack overflow. It doesn't have blog posts from developers all over the world. It even costs money!

There's nothing wrong with dash specifically, but I really don't understand what most GUI programs contribute. In an ideal world, my mac would only have chrome and [iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) installed as GUI programs. Heck, I'm writing this blog post on a chromebook that *only* has chrome installed as a GUI application and I'm able to do pretty much everything I need (after I installed a linux command line, of course).

I don't have anything against graphical user interfaces, either. I spend a huge amount of time using chrome and would not like it if didn't have a GUI. I just don't understand why people want to use programs that require all the hassles of downloading and installing and upgrading when there is almost always something that does what they need online.

Now, I when I voiced my opinion that chrome was all I needed for documentation, my coworkers pointed out that Dash works offline. Great! Now I just need to think back to the last time I was trying to program and wasn't connected to the internet! Hmmm... I can't seem to remember that ever happening.

I understand that not everyone feels this way. It's certainly not the worst thing in the world to have to install a little bit of software. I just feel like there is a better way.
