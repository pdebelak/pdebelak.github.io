Sometimes its easy to feel like you don't have time to do test-driven development. You know what code to write, so it seems like an unnecessary distraction to have to stop and write a test before writing the code you've planned.

I certainly used to feel this way, but then I started working as the primary developer on a big project. At first, everything was great. I was writing new features really quickly and everyone was really happy with it. I'd just write the code, quickly click Then, inevitably, something in the requirements changed. That was no problem, I knew how the code worked so I jumped in and made the change.
