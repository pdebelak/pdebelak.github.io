          <h2>My Three Favorite Websites</h2>
            <p>The goal of this post is to think about my three favorite websites and analyze their appearance, content, and design.</p>
            <h3>The Sites</h3>
              <p>After some deliberation, I determined that my favorite sites are <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/">Channel Fireball</a>, and <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/">SheldonBrown.com</a>.</p>
              <p>These sites are all very different and, at least in the case of Sheldon Brown's website, come from different eras of web design. Let's look at each site individually.</p>
            <h3>Google</h3>
              <p>I (and many others) use Google every day. I remember the old search engines (for some reason I always used alta vista) and Google was a huge improvement. One big appeal of Google at that time, too, was that the Google site loaded very quickly because it doesn't contain a bunch of images and news like some other search engines sites used to or still do. Over time a few extra features have appeared, mostly in the form of links at the top and bottom of the page, but the clean look and fast load time remain. Design-wise, clean is definitely the main word that comes to mind.</p>
              <p>Of course, the functionality of Google is what makes it the queen of search engines. The auto complete options seem to be able to read my mind. If I am trying to remember the name of the King of Saudi Arabia I just type "what" into Google and it somehow suggests "what is the name of the king of saudi arabia" as the first suggestion. It seems like magic.</p>
              <p>I feel like the design and content of Google work really well together. You go to Google in order to eventually go to a different website, so you want Google to sort of stay out of your way.</p>
            <h3>Channel Fireball</h3>
              <p>Channel Fireball is a site that sells Magic cards. It provides Magic strategy content for free to bring people to the site in order to eventually sell cards. It has certainly worked on me! The look is relatively uncluttered, with most of the content being arranged in two columns plus a sidebar.</p>
              <p>Assuming you check the site every couple days, it is easy to find what is new. The functionality to find older content, though, is not so great. The content is either broken up by author or not broken up at all when you look at the archive. If you are looking for a certain type of article or video and don't care about the author, the site can be frustrating to use. I feel like the user the site has in mind is someone who goes to the site everyday to see what is new and does not particularly worry about other users.</p>
              <p>This design approach matches well with the goal of the site. Channel Fireball wants to sell you the new cards, so they want you to see the new content. With the way Magic works, old content becomes obsolete quickly anyway, so I feel like something that might be a failing in a different kind of site is fine with this one.</p>
            <h3>SheldonBrown.com</h3>
              <p>This is <em>the</em> definitive site for bicycle information. It has been online since the late '90s and, as far as I know, has not changed significantly in its design. Web standards have changed significantly since this time and it really shows in the home page. There is no single way to navigate to each page on the site, instead there are a series of tables.</p>
              <p>The bicycle related content on the site is excellent. If you can locate the page, basically everything you need to know about bikes up to about 2007 (Sheldon Brown died in 2008) is there. The site is not focused in the way sites are now, though. He kept his personal journal, his photography, information about his ancestry, and tips for avoiding spam all on the same domain!</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>I feel like these sites are all very different. Overall, though, it seems like I care more about the content than the design.</p>
