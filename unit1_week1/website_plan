This is the plan for my website:

Not being very original, I want a header at the top and a footer at the bottom. The header will feature a small logo and some navigation links.
The footer will have a small copywrite notice and a link to email me.
For the body I think I will have a main body div with content for blog posts or whatever. There will be a sidebar with some images or whatever.

I want the site to look clean, not cluttered. Since I know I will have to write a blog post I want the layout to look good as a blog, with posts appearing in the main body area.
