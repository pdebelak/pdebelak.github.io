        <h2>Exploring My Values</h2>
          <p>In this post I will take some times to explore the values that are most important to me.</p>
        <h3>Values I associate with being the happiest</h3>
          <p>The values that I most associate with happiness or satisfaction are the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Competition</li>
            <li>Comfort</li>
            <li>Predictability</li>
            <li>Having a family</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>In depth about one of these values</h3>
          <p>Predictability is very important to me because I like to know what to expect. When I am in a new situation I often feel uncomfortable. Also, I have a hard time when someone else does something that surprises me. I guess in general I don't like surprises. This all seems kind of negative when I write it, but I'm happiest when everything is expected and as it should be.</p>
        <h3>Do I live up to these values?</h3>

        <h3>Last topic someone asked my advice on</h3>
          <p>Recently one of my employees was really bummed because some of his students did not like him as a teacher. He was feeling like a real failure and that he let the students down. I asked him if he had done anything differently from before and if he felt what he was teaching was valuable. He felt that he taught as he always did.</p>
          <p>Based on this, I felt that the issue may have been with his students rather than with his teaching. I don't like to dismiss a student's feedback, but it isn't always correct. This goes into something I try to follow, which is to remember that I can only control myself and what I do. If I do my best, then there isn't anything else I can do.</p>
