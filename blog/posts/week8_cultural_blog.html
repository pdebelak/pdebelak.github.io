        <h2>Mindset for DBC</h2>
          <p>With any situation, there are so many things we can't control. The one thing we <em>can</em> control is our mindset and how we react to things. For that reason, it is very important for the experience of Dev Bootcamp to approach it with the correct mindset.</p>
        <h3>Receiver or Participant?</h3>
          <p>It is easy for a DBC boot to think of himself as a receiver of information. I've paid a lot of money for DBC and expect to receive things in return. This is certainly true. I should expect to receive certain things, but having this general approach is the wrong way to learn. Instead of expecting to receive something, you should expect to participate in the process. It's easy to think after a day of learning, "Oh, I wish we had covered x." Don't ever feel like that! Be active in class and see if that can be covered! Other people likely feel the same way. Of course, there are other people so you can't get exactly what is perfect for you, but if everyone participates everyone will get a good chunk of what they want. If everyone just receives, it is likely that many people won't get what they need or want.</p>
        <h3>Managing expectations</h3>
          <p>I have a lot of educational experience in a type of class similar to how DBC works. I've worked for Kaplan Test Prep for almost 5 years and for the past 2 years have managed a single course and dealt with a lot of students. My Kaplan course and DBC are similar in that they are non-degree-granting, for-profit courses where people can't get loans. As a result, people expect a lot. I mean, they pay a lot of money! Also, the results are pretty concrete. At Kaplan people want to pass the test and at DBC people want a job. Finally, it is not entirely clear what is necessary to acheive these goals.</p>
          <p>As a result of this, it is important for students to have the right expectations. The school has expertise. DBC knows better than I do what an employer wants from a developer. At the same time, though, I know much better than DBC what <em>I</em> as an individual need to get the skills that DBC says I need. If I expect DBC to be the expert in both of these things, I will be frustrated and probably not succeed. If DBC expects me to both know what I need and what employers need, I might be way off and not learn the right things. We need to work together. Every time DBC introduces a new skill or mindset that employers want, I need to work with them to make sure I learn that skill.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Ultimately, you get out of education as much as you put in. I've seen people do really well with materials or courses that could use a lot of work because they put a lot in. At the same time, I've seen people do poorly with excellent courses and materials because they felt like they paid their money and should just automatically get what they paid for. That isn't how any education works. I hope to be able to give Dev Bootcamp my all and do really well there. I expect Dev Bootcamp to be right there with me and together we'll get me to where I need to be.</p>
