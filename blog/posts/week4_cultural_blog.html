        <h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>
          <p>We all have different strategies for dealing with conflict. My strategy is usually to withdraw into myself. The main issue with this strategy is that it does nothing to solve the conflict, only helps me cope with it. If the conflict doesn't go away on its own, I still have to deal with it eventually.</p>
        <h3>Example: My conflict at work</h3>
          <p>I work for a test preparation company. As part of my job I run practice tests for students who need to use computers connected to the internet to take these practice exams. For several months we had been having problems with the internet at work, it would occassionally go down making it impossible to run these practice tests.</p>
          <p>I spoke to my boss about the issue and how it effected the tests. He said he would work to solve the problem. We continued to have problems with the internet, though.</p>
        <h3>The conflict</h3>
          <p>The real meat of the conflict, was that I felt that when there were issues with the internet all the extra work generated (making it up to students, rescheduling, etc.) fell on me, even though I did not have control over fixing the problem. I felt that this was unfair, because with the situation as it stood it gave no incentive to my boss to solve the internet problem. It didn't generate extra work for him. It didn't even cost the company extra money because I am on salary. From his perspective, the only negative consequence was that I was upset and unhappy.</p>
        <h3>My reaction</h3>
          <p>I did not talk to my boss about how I was feeling, though. I just suffered through it for several months without talking to him more about the problem. I don't know how I thought it would get solved if I didn't tell him how I felt about the situation. I just got more upset. Eventually I got so upset that I got really angry at my boss. From his perspective it was a big surprise because he hadn't heard anything about the problem for months and then I kind of exploded at him. He was able to fix the problem, but if I had been more open earlier about how it was affecting me, it probably would have been fixed sooner and I would have felt better about it.</p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
          <p>Ultimately, my "solution" to this problem did nothing to fix it. Withdrawing might help me cope in the short term, but if the problem persists then it can only make things worse. In the future I should be more open about how I am feeling sooner. I can't expect people to know how I feel if I don't tell them.</p>
