        <h2>My Thinking Style</h2>
          <p>I feel like there are as many thinking styles as there are people, but it is helpful to try and categorize people a bit even if it results in generalization. One way of categorizing thinking styles was created by Anthony Gregorc. He divides everyone into abstract random, abstract sequential, concrete random, and concrete sequential styles. Based on what I've read and a test I took, I fall into the abstract sequential thinking style.</p>
        <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
          <p><strong>The Good:</strong> Abstract sequential thinkers like applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems. This is perfect for thinking through a programming problem and finding the best solution. Sequential thinkers think step by step, which is the same way that computers operate. Abstract thinkers are good at conceptualizing, which will help when thinking through a problem.</p>
          <p><strong>The Bad:</strong> Abstract sequential thinkers have a hard time expressing their emotions (they generally think sentimental thinking is not worthwhile), being diplomatic when convincing others, and not monopolizing a conversation. These qualities make working with other people difficult and pairing is a big part of programming, especially at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
        <h3>How to use this knowledge</h3>
          <p>Luckily I'm not just a computer who has to follow my programming! I can take the good of my thinking style while being conscious of the bad to minimize it. I will do my best to use my step-by-step thinking to improve the group's coding experience while remembering that others have a lot of value to add and consciously being quiet to allow others to participate. I also think it will be good to have discussions about emotions like we will have at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
          <p> No one's natural thinking style can be perfectly suited for all situations. I hope that keeping mine in mind will help me be aware of when to supress my natural inclinations and when to let my abstract sequential self free reign.</p>
