        <h2>Sexism in the Tech Industry</h2>
          <p>Is there sexism in the tech industry? There is sexism everywhere else, so it would be very suprising if there wasn't sexism in the tech industry as well. So, it might be a better question to ask if the sexism in the tech industry is worse or different than the sexism in the culture in general.</p>
        <h3>Women at the top</h3>
          <p>There are fewer women in director or executive positions in tech companies than in businesses in general. Look at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/silicon-valley-sexist_n_4731151.html">this article</a> with charts comparing the top 150 silicon valley companies with the S&P 100 companies. This represents a real problem since already in business women are less likely to be in positions of power. In the tech industry the problem is even worse! Ideally, there would be an equal number of men and women in these positions (since there are equal numbers of men and women) but the tech industry numbers should at least be equal to non-tech businesses.</p>
        <h3>Entering the field</h3>
          <p>One of the biggest challenges in combatting this type of imbalance is that it doesn't necessarily start in the work force. Women first have to become interesting in entering the tech field, and go through training before starting work. And sexism interferes with theses things as well.</p>
          <p>Without role models, fewer women want to enter the tech industry. Once a woman does decide to get training, she feels like an outsider because there are few other women training with her. By the time this woman is ready to enter the work force, sexism has already made it so she has few women peers.</p>
        <h3>Leaving the field</h3>
          <p>Once women are in the tech field, they are more likely to leave. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/10702952/Sexism-in-tech-GitHub-female-engineer-Horvaths-shock-exit-Sexist-nerdy-priesthood-regime-is-killing-tech-industry.html">41% of women in tech jobs leave after 10 years.</a> This is much higher than the rate for men. While some of this has to do with the usual things like women being more likely to leave jobs when they have children (because of sexism), I think it points to something wrong specifically in the tech field.</p>
        <h3>Solutions?</h3>
          <p>I don't think this problem has any easy solutions. So many aspects of the problem are deeply engrained into our culture. I think the most important step to take is to be as open as possible that there is a problem. We have to acknowledge the problem in order to do anything about it. The second is to understand that casual sexism leads to institutional problems. We can't stand around and not say anything when someone says something casually sexist. We have to say that it is wrong. Eventually people will start to think about the things they say and do. This will make women feel more comfortable being around men who work in the tech field. Once that happens the numbers might slowly start to even out.</p>
          <p>It would be great if the tech industry could be pointed to as the one field that <em>isn't</em> sexist rather than one that is particularly so. I hope to some day be proud of the openness and acceptance found in my field.</p>
