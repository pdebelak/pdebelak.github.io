          <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
            <p>Stereotype threat is when you are concerned about reinforcing a negative stereotype about a group you belong to. There are a many possible ways stereotype threat can come up. A black person might be concerned about sounding too "black" and thus be thought stupid or uneducated. As a result, they may speak more correctly than the average person to avoid confirming the stereotype some people hold about black people. A woman might say that she doesn't have any female friends so she doesn't seem catty or some other stereotype that people have about women. Regardless of the manifestation, stereotype threat means that people feel that they cannot be themselves because they are worried about confirming a negative stereotype. This is damaging.</p>
          <h3>My Experience</h3>
            <p>As a white man, I am mostly immune to this or any discrimination based on gender or race. The closest I can come to experiences discrimination is when I ride a bike to work. What is the negative stereotype about cyclists? They ignore the rules of the road! Now, anyone who pays attention knows that drivers in cars rarely stop at stop signs, stop for people in crosswalks, or respect red lights. That is not relevant, however. When cycling, I find myself overcompensating for this by following rules of the road that I sometimes ignore even when driving. Part of it is to fight the stereotype, but part of it is because of the very real consequence of these stereotypes. If I am in a collision with a car, the assumption is that the cyclist was at fault due to dangerous and illegal behavior. My only defense against this is to always follow the letter of the law.</p>
          <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p>So, how can we combat stereotype threat? The most important thing is to not put up with stereotypes! Don't mutely accept the accepted wisdom that women aren't as good as men at math or that black mothers abuse social programs. Challenge people who repeat these types of stereotypes. If you think someone else is suffering from stereotype threat you need to make it clear that you consider that person an individual and are not concerned about how they fit into the gender, race, or sexual orientation groups they might belong to. Finally, you must never be defensive if someone tells you that they are feeling stereotype threat because of something you are doing. Everyone should feel comfortable being open about these things so we can work towards a solution.</p>
