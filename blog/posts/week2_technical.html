          <h2>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h2>
            <p>Pretty much any interactive page on the internet uses JavaScript. There are so many computer programming languages out there, so why is this?</p>
          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>One of the earliest web browsers was Netscape Navigator. For a while in the '90s, it was by far the most popluar way to access the internet. Along with this browser, Netscape developed JavaScript to allow scripting of webpages. This meant that content on the page could be generated dynamically and users could interact more with the page. Since Netscape Navigator was the standard, JavaScript became the standard along with it.</p>
          <h3>Client-Side Language</h3>
            <p>Unlike most languages that live on the "server side", JavaScript is primarily a client-side language. What does this mean? The interpretation of the programming language is actually done by your web browser! So rather than having the program living on the server, which then presents a static html webpage to your computer, the program happens in your browser which allows the webpage to change based on what you type in or what buttons you click. This is what we expect from websites and JavaScript is how it is done.</p>
          <h3>The Power</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is full computer programming language that can do pretty much anything another language can do. Despite being born along with web browsers and the internet, you could program almost anything using JavaScript. This means that while working on a website, programmers are never left without the type of functionality that they might be used to in another programming language.</p>
            <p>JavaScript has been the standard for a long time, and there isn't much of a chance this will change. Every new web browser is going to make sure it works well with JavaScript, otherwise users are going to find that their favorite websites no longer work like they are used to. Even if something new comes along, JavaScript will stick around.</p>
