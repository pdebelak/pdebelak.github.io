        <h2>Importance of Values</h2>
          <p>My values are extremely important to me. I can't imagine feeling compelled to not follow my values because of what others think. When people feel stereotype threat (see last week's post for the details), though, that is part of what they are feeling. I think that makes it doubly important to ensure that we try to minimize stereotype threat.</p>
        <h3>My Values</h3>
          <p>When I think about my values, I'd say they are either the things that make me happy or the things that are so important that I'd put them ahead of my happiness. These are the most important things in my life.</p>
        <h3>When faced with threats</h3>
          <p>When faced with a threat to my values or happiness, I should think about my values. Is there a way I can bring my feelings more in line with my values and feel better about this threat?</p>
          <p>Another way to deal with things that get me down, I've found, is to identify my feelings. Just thinking "I'm feeling down" does a lot to separate me from that feeling. I can then try to identify what the real cause of it is, or at least try to do some of the things that make me happy.</p>
