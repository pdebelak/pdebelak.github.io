<p>Just like <a href="/blog/posts/tappety-tap-tap-tap-object-tap-in-ruby/">last time</a>,
where I wrote about the underused <code>Object#tap</code> method, I want to talk about
a relatively new and underutilized feature in Ruby. Today it is named arguments.</p>

<p>Starting in Ruby 2.0, you could give your arguments names like so:</p>

<pre><code>def method(argument: "default")
  argument.length
end
</code></pre>

<p>This was nice, but since you were forced to provide a default value it wasn’t
always super useful. Starting in Ruby 2.1, though, the requirement for a default
was dropped so now you can write:</p>

<pre><code>def method(argument:)
  argument.length
end
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this so great? It provides documentation when a method is called. Have
you ever run across a method call like <code>do_thing(user, false)</code> in
an existing codebase? Don’t you immediately have to look up the <code>do_thing</code>
method to figure out what that <code>false</code> means? What if, instead, you saw
<code>do_thing(user: user, async: false)</code>? Now you don’t need to lookup
the code for that method since it is clear what the <code>false</code> means.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that the order doesn’t matter. <code>do_thing(async: false, user: user)</code>
works just as well. Just last week I spent almost an hour figuring out why a
test wasn’t passing before I realized I had some positional arguments in the
wrong order. Named arguments avoid that.</p>

<p>The name of the arguments can also give reminders about what type the arguments
should be. If you are supposed to pass a user id to the method, <code>do_thing(user, false)</code>
is a much easier mistake to make than <code>do_thing(user_id: user, async: false)</code>.
It is immediately obvious that it should be <code>do_thing(user_id: user.id, async: false)</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, Ruby is much more helpful about what is wrong when you forget a named
argument than positional arguments. If you try <code>do_thing(user)</code> you
get an error like <code>ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)</code>. Then
you have to look at the method definition to see what you forgot. With named
arguments if you try <code>do_thing(user: user)</code>, you get an error like
<code>ArgumentError: missing keyword: async</code>, which is much more informative.</p>

<p>The only downsides to named arguments are that they make your method calls a
little more verbose, and that it makes any gems or libraries you create not as
backwards compatible. I think the verbosity is worth it, though, and I think
once Rails 5 comes out and people have to switch to Ruby 2.2 to use it, backwards
compatibility won’t be such a big issue. In a private codebase, of course, you
don’t have to worry about compatibility with old Rubies, so there is no downside
there.</p>

<p>I encourage you to use named arguments as much as possible. I think you’ll see
the benefits right away!</p>
