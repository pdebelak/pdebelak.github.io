<p>There are a number of features that were added to Ruby in versions 1.9 or later
that don’t seem to be in wide use for some reason. One that I have a fondness
for is the <code>tap</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>tap</code> method was added to the <code>Object</code> class in Ruby 1.9. All it does is
yield <code>self</code> to a block and then return <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>Object.new.tap do |object|
  puts object
end
# returns the object
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn’t that seem useful? Not really? Okay. Well, according to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-tap">the docs</a>
the method is meant to “tap into” a method chain, in the same way you’d tap
into a rich vein of silver. Let’s see if we can find the silver here.</p>

<p>Imagine you need to create an object, call one of its methods, and then return
it.</p>

<pre><code>Hat.new(type: :bowler).tap do |hat|
  hat.tip
end
</code></pre>

<p>We’re getting closer.</p>

<p>What if you need to construct a string in a complicated way?</p>

<pre><code>"".tap do |string|
  string &lt;&lt; "Hello " if hello
  string &lt;&lt; "Sir " if should_sir?
  string &lt;&lt; "I'm writing to you"
  string &lt;&lt; " about #{about}" if about
  string &lt;&lt; "."
end
</code></pre>

<p>That’s so much better than the <code>string = ""; string &lt;&lt; "X" if something</code> alternative
that ends with <code>string</code> at the end to make sure you return it. <code>tap</code> takes care
of that for you.</p>

<p>The biggest benefit I’ve found of using <code>tap</code> is that it makes it easy to create
a variable with limited scope. This can be very useful in Rails views, especially
if you use decorators to add view-related methods to an object.</p>

<p>Take this haml:</p>

<pre><code>- decorated_post = PostDecorator.new(@post)
%h1= decorated_post.decorated_title
%p= decorated_post.decorated_body
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all fine, but if you are in a situation where you want to use two different
decorators in the same view, you might have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- readably_decorated_post = ReadablePostDecorator.new(@post)
%h1= readably_decorated_post.decorated_title
%p= readably_decorated_post.decorated_body

- sortably_decorated_post = SortablePostDecorator.new(@post)
= link_to sortably_decorated_post.next_post
</code></pre>

<p>It can be hard to keep track of where a variable might be used and how. Also,
those variable names are long to differentiate from themselves from each
other. Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>- ReadablePostDecorator.new(@post).tap do |decorated_post|
  %h1= decorated_post.decorated_title
  %p= decorated_post.decorated_body

- SortablePostDecorator.new(@post).tap do |decorated_post|
  = link_to decorated_post.next_post
</code></pre>

<p>I find that more readable and you have a good idea of the start and end of the
scope of the variables.</p>

<p>I hope this encourages you to bring out <code>Object#tap</code> for a little spin the next
chance you get.</p>
