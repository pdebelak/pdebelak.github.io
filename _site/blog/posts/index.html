  <h1 class="blog-index">Trying Out Emacs<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/trying-out-emacs/#disqus_thread">comments</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 11 July 2015</p>
  <p>When I started working at <a href="https://reverb.com">Reverb</a> I had a medium amount of vim experience, mostly from programming on a chromebook. At Reverb, though, the expectation is that all programmers use vim (specifically mvim) using our CTO’s excellent vim configuration (which you can see here: <a href="https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles">https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles</a>) to foster easy pairing.</p>

<p>I felt instantly pretty much as productive as I was in <a href="http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/">Caret</a> or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, which honestly wasn’t that productive. After a little bit, though, I was navigating both around the current file and through the very large Reverb codebase with ease, never touching the mouse, and doing all the things that make people love vim so much.</p>

<p>Naturally, this made me curious about emacs.</p>

<p>I had tried to go through the basic emacs tutor around the same time I was learning vim basics and quit almost immediately once I learned the incredibly perverse navigation commands. Not only did you have to hit control constantly, the keys to move the cursor were all over the place!</p>

<p>But, people still really love emacs so I was curious about why. I decided to give it a try, but using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">evil mode</a> to use vim bindings within emacs. You might wonder what the point of using emacs at all is, if I’m just going to make it as much like vim as possible. Well, turns out it’s all the other stuff that emacs gives you.</p>

<p>Take a look at this screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="/images/editing-in-emacs.png" alt="Editing and using the internet in emacs" /></p>

<p>If you can’t tell, I’m editing a markdown file for the blog on the left while looking at the post in the brower on the right. In fact, the ability to browse the internet in a text only mode while having all my vim keybindings is the main reason I’m enjoying emacs so much.</p>

<p>I’m still pretty new at using emacs and am learning a lot, but so far I’m really glad I decided to give it a try. If I don’t give up soon, I’ll probably have more updates on my progress and configuration</p>

<p>Just imagine a world where you can use vim all the time: whether it’s for editing text, browsing the internet, or reading pdf files. The way to do it is to use emacs.</p>

  <h1 class="blog-index">New Heroku Pricing<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/new-heroku-pricing/#disqus_thread">comments</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 27 June 2015</p>
  <p><a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/5/7/new-dyno-types-public-beta">Heroku’s new pricing</a>
introduces much better pricing for anyone who has been paying for Heroku’s
services, but introduces a huge change for people wanting to host their apps
for free — required downtime. Now all free apps have to sleep for 6 hours in
every 24 hour period.</p>

<p>What they are actually doing is making their free tier better for people who
use it in the way that they want — to get an app up and running in a
production environment for testing. They now give you a free web and worker
dyno so you can set up <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">sidekiq</a> at no cost while you are developing the app.
Previously, if you wanted to use a second dyno at all you almost certainly
had to pay some money.</p>

<p>Once users like this are ready to go into prime time they can either go through the
hassle of switching to a different hosting service like Amazon, or they can
just pay Heroku some money every month for more dynos that are always live.
Clearly, this is what Heroku wants.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t using the free tier of Heroku to test out an app in
development. I just wanted a single web dyno that, if pinged once an hour, was
up all the time to host my personal website. I had no plans of ever giving
Heroku any money, so it really makes no sense to give me free hosting. My
best option with Heroku would be to pay $7 a month to get a site that is always
up, and that is more than I’m willing to spend at the moment.</p>

<p>So, Heroku did very well. They are now giving free hosting to the people using
the service in the way that they want and stopping giving free hosting to
people who, like me, have no intention of ever paying.</p>

<p>As a result, I’ve switched this site’s technology (again). Now I’m using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>
and hosting for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github</a>. Which is great!</p>

  <h1 class="blog-index">Name Thy Args - Named Arguments in Ruby<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/name-thy-args-named-arguments-in-ruby/#disqus_thread">comments</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 21 June 2015</p>
  <p>Just like <a href="/blog/posts/tappety-tap-tap-tap-object-tap-in-ruby/">last time</a>,
where I wrote about the underused <code>Object#tap</code> method, I want to talk about
a relatively new and underutilized feature in Ruby. Today it is named arguments.</p>

<p>Starting in Ruby 2.0, you could give your arguments names like so:</p>

<pre><code>def method(argument: "default")
  argument.length
end
</code></pre>

<p>This was nice, but since you were forced to provide a default value it wasn’t
always super useful. Starting in Ruby 2.1, though, the requirement for a default
was dropped so now you can write:</p>

<pre><code>def method(argument:)
  argument.length
end
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this so great? It provides documentation when a method is called. Have
you ever run across a method call like <code>do_thing(user, false)</code> in
an existing codebase? Don’t you immediately have to look up the <code>do_thing</code>
method to figure out what that <code>false</code> means? What if, instead, you saw
<code>do_thing(user: user, async: false)</code>? Now you don’t need to lookup
the code for that method since it is clear what the <code>false</code> means.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that the order doesn’t matter. <code>do_thing(async: false, user: user)</code>
works just as well. Just last week I spent almost an hour figuring out why a
test wasn’t passing before I realized I had some positional arguments in the
wrong order. Named arguments avoid that.</p>

<p>The name of the arguments can also give reminders about what type the arguments
should be. If you are supposed to pass a user id to the method, <code>do_thing(user, false)</code>
is a much easier mistake to make than <code>do_thing(user_id: user, async: false)</code>.
It is immediately obvious that it should be <code>do_thing(user_id: user.id, async: false)</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, Ruby is much more helpful about what is wrong when you forget a named
argument than positional arguments. If you try <code>do_thing(user)</code> you
get an error like <code>ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)</code>. Then
you have to look at the method definition to see what you forgot. With named
arguments if you try <code>do_thing(user: user)</code>, you get an error like
<code>ArgumentError: missing keyword: async</code>, which is much more informative.</p>

<p>The only downsides to named arguments are that they make your method calls a
little more verbose, and that it makes any gems or libraries you create not as
backwards compatible. I think the verbosity is worth it, though, and I think
once Rails 5 comes out and people have to switch to Ruby 2.2 to use it, backwards
compatibility won’t be such a big issue. In a private codebase, of course, you
don’t have to worry about compatibility with old Rubies, so there is no downside
there.</p>

<p>I encourage you to use named arguments as much as possible. I think you’ll see
the benefits right away!</p>
