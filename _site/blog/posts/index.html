  <h1 class="blog-index">Tappety Tap Tap Tap Tap - Object#tap in Ruby<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/tappety-tap-tap-tap-object-tap-in-ruby/">permalink</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 18 June 2015</p>
  <p>There are a number of features that were added to Ruby in versions 1.9 or later
that don’t seem to be in wide use for some reason. One that I have a fondness
for is the <code>tap</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>tap</code> method was added to the <code>Object</code> class in Ruby 1.9. All it does is
yield <code>self</code> to a block and then return <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>Object.new.tap do |object|
  puts object
end
# returns the object
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn’t that seem useful? Not really? Okay. Well, according to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-tap">the docs</a>
the method is meant to “tap into” a method chain, in the same way you’d tap
into a rich vein of silver. Let’s see if we can find the silver here.</p>

<p>Imagine you need to create an object, call one of its methods, and then return
it.</p>

<pre><code>Hat.new(type: :bowler).tap do |hat|
  hat.tip
end
</code></pre>

<p>We’re getting closer.</p>

<p>What if you need to construct a string in a complicated way?</p>

<pre><code>"".tap do |string|
  string &lt;&lt; "Hello " if hello
  string &lt;&lt; "Sir " if should_sir?
  string &lt;&lt; "I'm writing to you"
  string &lt;&lt; " about #{about}" if about
  string &lt;&lt; "."
end
</code></pre>

<p>That’s so much better than the <code>string = ""; string &lt;&lt; "X" if something</code> alternative
that ends with <code>string</code> at the end to make sure you return it. <code>tap</code> takes care
of that for you.</p>

<p>The biggest benefit I’ve found of using <code>tap</code> is that it makes it easy to create
a variable with limited scope. This can be very useful in Rails views, especially
if you use decorators to add view-related methods to an object.</p>

<p>Take this haml:</p>

<pre><code>- decorated_post = PostDecorator.new(@post)
%h1= decorated_post.decorated_title
%p= decorated_post.decorated_body
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all fine, but if you are in a situation where you want to use two different
decorators in the same view, you might have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- readably_decorated_post = ReadablePostDecorator.new(@post)
%h1= readably_decorated_post.decorated_title
%p= readably_decorated_post.decorated_body

- sortably_decorated_post = SortablePostDecorator.new(@post)
= link_to sortably_decorated_post.next_post
</code></pre>

<p>It can be hard to keep track of where a variable might be used and how. Also,
those variable names are long to differentiate from themselves from each
other. Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>- ReadablePostDecorator.new(@post).tap do |decorated_post|
  %h1= decorated_post.decorated_title
  %p= decorated_post.decorated_body

- SortablePostDecorator.new(@post).tap do |decorated_post|
  = link_to decorated_post.next_post
</code></pre>

<p>I find that more readable and you have a good idea of the start and end of the
scope of the variables.</p>

<p>I hope this encourages you to bring out <code>Object#tap</code> for a little spin the next
chance you get.</p>

  <h1 class="blog-index">Why You Run Your Tests First<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/why-you-run-your-tests-first/">permalink</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 14 June 2015</p>
  <p>When first learning test-driven-development, there are a lot of things about it
that seem stupid and arbitrary. After working with it a while, though, you
start to see that at least some of the rules make a lot of sense. The phrase
most associated with TDD is “red, green, refactor”. Now, when I was first
learning about TDD the green and refactor steps made a lot of sense, but why
do I need to do the red step? I <em>know</em> the test will fail, because I haven’t
written the code yet!</p>

<p>Now I understand, though, so I wanted to share what I learned with future
doubters.</p>

<p class="lead">You only <em>think</em> you know what the bug is</p>

<p>When fixing bugs in a large project at work, I usually have an exception that
occurred in production with details in <a href="https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby">honeybadger</a>.
I usually read the trace from the exception and think through where the problem
might be. I then tend to have a very good idea of how to solve the issue.</p>

<p>The only way I <em>know</em> I’m fixing the issue, though, is to write a test that
replicates the problem. Frequently I’ll write the test and, by running it, discover that it
doesn’t actually cause the same exception I expected it to, or that it doesn’t cause
any exception at all! If I wrote the test, changed the code, and then ran the
test I’d think that the bug was fixed. By running the test first I verify that
I’m fixing the thing I think I am.</p>

<p>The same idea applies to writing new features. If you run your tests first,
you can verify that you are getting the error you expect to get. When you write
a test like this:</p>

<pre><code>specify { Thing.new.do_thing.should == "hello" }
</code></pre>

<p>And your current code is:</p>

<pre><code>class Thing
  def do_thing
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>You run the test to see <code>expected "doing a thing", got nil</code>. This means that
the rest of your code is working as you expect, and your planned code will make
the test pass. Without running the test, you might write your code, then
discover that you mistyped the method name, or that your method is returning
something unexpected. Until you get the failure you want, you don’t really
understand your code.</p>

<p>I hope that helps explain why the seemingly stupid step of running a test you
know will fail is actually helpful.</p>

  <h1 class="blog-index">Switching Away from Angular<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/switching-away-from-angular/">permalink</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 27 February 2015</p>
  <p>As I’ve spent more time working with Rails, I’ve realized that, even without
Angular, a Rails site is capable of being fully-interactive, ajax-powered
fun-times machine. I know what you’re thinking: “Duh! That’s true of everything
from plain <code>html</code> to <code>php</code>!” Okay, yes, that’s true. But with Rails you can do
it without really having to translate between server-side and javascript. Here’s
what I mean:</p>

<p class="lead">Unobtrusive Javascript</p>

<p>Using jQuery for a ajax-heavy site is truly obtrusive to your experience to a
developer. Every time you type <code>event.preventDefault()</code> you are saying, “Don’t
do the thing that I wrote code for, do something else that requires more code!”
Angular makes this better with its <code>ng-click</code>s and <code>ng-submit</code>s, but you still
have to spend time formulating a <code>json</code> response, and then translating that
response into html in your javascript.</p>

<p>With unobtrusive javascript, you can respond with a <code>js.erb</code> file that just
inserts a partial you already wrote for the initial <code>html</code> response, so your
total new code is adding <code>format.js</code> to your controller and
<code>$('selector').html('&lt;%= j render partial: "a partial" %&gt;')</code>. Obviously it
can be more complicated than that, but it usually isn’t.</p>

<p class="lead">Degrading Gracefully</p>

<p>Honestly, I don’t think degrading gracefully when javascript is not enabled is
very important, but if I can do it while writing less code than Angular I see
that as a win. It is comforting to know that if my grandma accidentally turned
javascript off in her browser she can still use my site just fine.</p>

<p class="lead">My conclusion</p>

<p>So I removed Angular from this site. I know it doesn’t really matter to users,
but for me it’s made life easier. Since there is less code to write, I’m more
likely to add new features. For example, I’ve already updated the site to use
<code>markdown</code> instead of <code>html</code>, which has made writing posts faster and more fun!</p>

<p>I still think Angular is great and will continue to use it for projects, but I
think when it comes to Rails, I’ll keep using unobtrusive javascript until I
have a real reason not to.</p>
