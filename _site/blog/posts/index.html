  <h1 class="blog-index">Name Thy Args - Named Arguments in Ruby<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/name-thy-args-named-arguments-in-ruby/">permalink</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 21 June 2015</p>
  <p>Just like <a href="/blog/posts/tappety-tap-tap-tap-object-tap-in-ruby/">last time</a>,
where I wrote about the underused <code>Object#tap</code> method, I want to talk about
a relatively new and underutilized feature in Ruby. Today it is named arguments.</p>

<p>Starting in Ruby 2.0, you could give your arguments names like so:</p>

<pre><code>def method(argument: "default")
  argument.length
end
</code></pre>

<p>This was nice, but since you were forced to provide a default value it wasn’t
always super useful. Starting in Ruby 2.1, though, the requirement for a default
was dropped so now you can write:</p>

<pre><code>def method(argument:)
  argument.length
end
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this so great? It provides documentation when a method is called. Have
you ever run across a method call like <code>do_thing(user, false)</code> in
an existing codebase? Don’t you immediately have to look up the <code>do_thing</code>
method to figure out what that <code>false</code> means? What if, instead, you saw
<code>do_thing(user: user, async: false)</code>? Now you don’t need to lookup
the code for that method since it is clear what the <code>false</code> means.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that the order doesn’t matter. <code>do_thing(async: false, user: user)</code>
works just as well. Just last week I spent almost an hour figuring out why a
test wasn’t passing before I realized I had some positional arguments in the
wrong order. Named arguments avoid that.</p>

<p>The name of the arguments can also give reminders about what type the arguments
should be. If you are supposed to pass a user id to the method, <code>do_thing(user, false)</code>
is a much easier mistake to make than <code>do_thing(user_id: user, async: false)</code>.
It is immediately obvious that it should be <code>do_thing(user_id: user.id, async: false)</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, Ruby is much more helpful about what is wrong when you forget a named
argument than positional arguments. If you try <code>do_thing(user)</code> you
get an error like <code>ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)</code>. Then
you have to look at the method definition to see what you forgot. With named
arguments if you try <code>do_thing(user: user)</code>, you get an error like
<code>ArgumentError: missing keyword: async</code>, which is much more informative.</p>

<p>The only downsides to named arguments are that they make your method calls a
little more verbose, and that it makes any gems or libraries you create not as
backwards compatible. I think the verbosity is worth it, though, and I think
once Rails 5 comes out and people have to switch to Ruby 2.2 to use it, backwards
compatibility won’t be such a big issue. In a private codebase, of course, you
don’t have to worry about compatibility with old Rubies, so there is no downside
there.</p>

<p>I encourage you to use named arguments as much as possible. I think you’ll see
the benefits right away!</p>

  <h1 class="blog-index">Tappety Tap Tap Tap Tap - Object#tap in Ruby<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/tappety-tap-tap-tap-object-tap-in-ruby/">permalink</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 18 June 2015</p>
  <p>There are a number of features that were added to Ruby in versions 1.9 or later
that don’t seem to be in wide use for some reason. One that I have a fondness
for is the <code>tap</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>tap</code> method was added to the <code>Object</code> class in Ruby 1.9. All it does is
yield <code>self</code> to a block and then return <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>Object.new.tap do |object|
  puts object
end
# returns the object
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn’t that seem useful? Not really? Okay. Well, according to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Object.html#method-i-tap">the docs</a>
the method is meant to “tap into” a method chain, in the same way you’d tap
into a rich vein of silver. Let’s see if we can find the silver here.</p>

<p>Imagine you need to create an object, call one of its methods, and then return
it.</p>

<pre><code>Hat.new(type: :bowler).tap do |hat|
  hat.tip
end
</code></pre>

<p>We’re getting closer.</p>

<p>What if you need to construct a string in a complicated way?</p>

<pre><code>"".tap do |string|
  string &lt;&lt; "Hello " if hello
  string &lt;&lt; "Sir " if should_sir?
  string &lt;&lt; "I'm writing to you"
  string &lt;&lt; " about #{about}" if about
  string &lt;&lt; "."
end
</code></pre>

<p>That’s so much better than the <code>string = ""; string &lt;&lt; "X" if something</code> alternative
that ends with <code>string</code> at the end to make sure you return it. <code>tap</code> takes care
of that for you.</p>

<p>The biggest benefit I’ve found of using <code>tap</code> is that it makes it easy to create
a variable with limited scope. This can be very useful in Rails views, especially
if you use decorators to add view-related methods to an object.</p>

<p>Take this haml:</p>

<pre><code>- decorated_post = PostDecorator.new(@post)
%h1= decorated_post.decorated_title
%p= decorated_post.decorated_body
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all fine, but if you are in a situation where you want to use two different
decorators in the same view, you might have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- readably_decorated_post = ReadablePostDecorator.new(@post)
%h1= readably_decorated_post.decorated_title
%p= readably_decorated_post.decorated_body

- sortably_decorated_post = SortablePostDecorator.new(@post)
= link_to sortably_decorated_post.next_post
</code></pre>

<p>It can be hard to keep track of where a variable might be used and how. Also,
those variable names are long to differentiate from themselves from each
other. Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>- ReadablePostDecorator.new(@post).tap do |decorated_post|
  %h1= decorated_post.decorated_title
  %p= decorated_post.decorated_body

- SortablePostDecorator.new(@post).tap do |decorated_post|
  = link_to decorated_post.next_post
</code></pre>

<p>I find that more readable and you have a good idea of the start and end of the
scope of the variables.</p>

<p>I hope this encourages you to bring out <code>Object#tap</code> for a little spin the next
chance you get.</p>

  <h1 class="blog-index">Why You Run Your Tests First<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/why-you-run-your-tests-first/">permalink</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 14 June 2015</p>
  <p>When first learning test-driven-development, there are a lot of things about it
that seem stupid and arbitrary. After working with it a while, though, you
start to see that at least some of the rules make a lot of sense. The phrase
most associated with TDD is “red, green, refactor”. Now, when I was first
learning about TDD the green and refactor steps made a lot of sense, but why
do I need to do the red step? I <em>know</em> the test will fail, because I haven’t
written the code yet!</p>

<p>Now I understand, though, so I wanted to share what I learned with future
doubters.</p>

<p class="lead">You only <em>think</em> you know what the bug is</p>

<p>When fixing bugs in a large project at work, I usually have an exception that
occurred in production with details in <a href="https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby">honeybadger</a>.
I usually read the trace from the exception and think through where the problem
might be. I then tend to have a very good idea of how to solve the issue.</p>

<p>The only way I <em>know</em> I’m fixing the issue, though, is to write a test that
replicates the problem. Frequently I’ll write the test and, by running it, discover that it
doesn’t actually cause the same exception I expected it to, or that it doesn’t cause
any exception at all! If I wrote the test, changed the code, and then ran the
test I’d think that the bug was fixed. By running the test first I verify that
I’m fixing the thing I think I am.</p>

<p>The same idea applies to writing new features. If you run your tests first,
you can verify that you are getting the error you expect to get. When you write
a test like this:</p>

<pre><code>specify { Thing.new.do_thing.should == "hello" }
</code></pre>

<p>And your current code is:</p>

<pre><code>class Thing
  def do_thing
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>You run the test to see <code>expected "doing a thing", got nil</code>. This means that
the rest of your code is working as you expect, and your planned code will make
the test pass. Without running the test, you might write your code, then
discover that you mistyped the method name, or that your method is returning
something unexpected. Until you get the failure you want, you don’t really
understand your code.</p>

<p>I hope that helps explain why the seemingly stupid step of running a test you
know will fail is actually helpful.</p>
