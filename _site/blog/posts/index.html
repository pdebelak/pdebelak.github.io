  <h1 class="blog-index">Managing Configuration on Multiple Machines<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/managing-configuration-on-multiple-machines/#disqus_thread">comments</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 29 August 2015</p>
  <p>Well, my experiment with emacs ended when I realized that getting the shell to work properly wasn’t going to happen unless I was willing to put some serious work in. It just didn’t seem worth it. So, I’m back to vim.</p>

<p>As I said <a href="/blog/posts/trying-out-emacs">before</a>, I use <a href="https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles">yadr</a> for my vim and zsh configuration. Lately, though, I’ve been trying to add some tmux excitement to my normal workflows and so I needed to add some additional tmux-based keybindings. Yadr has a way to do this without needing to fork it - by using a <code>~/.zsh.after</code> directory with additional configuration. The problem with this, though, is that I needed to remember to update my config on both my personal and work computers whenever I made a change.</p>

<p>Clearly this was not exceptable. I needed to DRY up my life!</p>

<p>So, what I created a repo on github with my configuration files. The issue with this, of course, is that you need a way to clone the repo, but then put the files in the correct place (I also have a <code>~/.gitconfig.user</code> file in there, for instance, so I can’t just clone everything into <code>~/.zsh.after</code>) without having to remember where to put what. So I made a basic bash script that I run whenever I pull that symlinks the files into the correct place. Then, to keep my configuration files in sync, all I need to do is commit any changes, push it up to github, and then pull those changes down onto my other computer.</p>

<p>You can see the repo <a href="https://github.com/pdebelak/env">here</a> if you want to get an idea of what is involved. I hope you find this technique helpful!</p>

  <h1 class="blog-index">Trying Out Emacs<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/trying-out-emacs/#disqus_thread">comments</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 11 July 2015</p>
  <p>When I started working at <a href="https://reverb.com">Reverb</a> I had a medium amount of vim experience, mostly from programming on a chromebook. At Reverb, though, the expectation is that all programmers use vim (specifically mvim) using our CTO’s excellent vim configuration (which you can see here: <a href="https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles">https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles</a>) to foster easy pairing.</p>

<p>I felt instantly pretty much as productive as I was in <a href="http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/">Caret</a> or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, which honestly wasn’t that productive. After a little bit, though, I was navigating both around the current file and through the very large Reverb codebase with ease, never touching the mouse, and doing all the things that make people love vim so much.</p>

<p>Naturally, this made me curious about emacs.</p>

<p>I had tried to go through the basic emacs tutor around the same time I was learning vim basics and quit almost immediately once I learned the incredibly perverse navigation commands. Not only did you have to hit control constantly, the keys to move the cursor were all over the place!</p>

<p>But, people still really love emacs so I was curious about why. I decided to give it a try, but using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">evil mode</a> to use vim bindings within emacs. You might wonder what the point of using emacs at all is, if I’m just going to make it as much like vim as possible. Well, turns out it’s all the other stuff that emacs gives you.</p>

<p>Take a look at this screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="/images/editing-in-emacs.png" alt="Editing and using the internet in emacs" /></p>

<p>If you can’t tell, I’m editing a markdown file for the blog on the left while looking at the post in the brower on the right. In fact, the ability to browse the internet in a text only mode while having all my vim keybindings is the main reason I’m enjoying emacs so much.</p>

<p>I’m still pretty new at using emacs and am learning a lot, but so far I’m really glad I decided to give it a try. If I don’t give up soon, I’ll probably have more updates on my progress and configuration</p>

<p>Just imagine a world where you can use vim all the time: whether it’s for editing text, browsing the internet, or reading pdf files. The way to do it is to use emacs.</p>

  <h1 class="blog-index">New Heroku Pricing<br><small><a href="/blog/posts/new-heroku-pricing/#disqus_thread">comments</a></small></h1>
  <p class="date-line">Last updated 27 June 2015</p>
  <p><a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/5/7/new-dyno-types-public-beta">Heroku’s new pricing</a>
introduces much better pricing for anyone who has been paying for Heroku’s
services, but introduces a huge change for people wanting to host their apps
for free — required downtime. Now all free apps have to sleep for 6 hours in
every 24 hour period.</p>

<p>What they are actually doing is making their free tier better for people who
use it in the way that they want — to get an app up and running in a
production environment for testing. They now give you a free web and worker
dyno so you can set up <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">sidekiq</a> at no cost while you are developing the app.
Previously, if you wanted to use a second dyno at all you almost certainly
had to pay some money.</p>

<p>Once users like this are ready to go into prime time they can either go through the
hassle of switching to a different hosting service like Amazon, or they can
just pay Heroku some money every month for more dynos that are always live.
Clearly, this is what Heroku wants.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t using the free tier of Heroku to test out an app in
development. I just wanted a single web dyno that, if pinged once an hour, was
up all the time to host my personal website. I had no plans of ever giving
Heroku any money, so it really makes no sense to give me free hosting. My
best option with Heroku would be to pay $7 a month to get a site that is always
up, and that is more than I’m willing to spend at the moment.</p>

<p>So, Heroku did very well. They are now giving free hosting to the people using
the service in the way that they want and stopping giving free hosting to
people who, like me, have no intention of ever paying.</p>

<p>As a result, I’ve switched this site’s technology (again). Now I’m using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>
and hosting for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github</a>. Which is great!</p>
